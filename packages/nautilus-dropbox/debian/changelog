nautilus-dropbox (1.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add "Conflicts: dropbox" since dropbox (the company) renamed
    their nautilus-dropbox into dropbox, and the same software is
    now packaged under two package names. Closes: #686863

nautilus-dropbox (1.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update add-http-proxy-option.patch and use-pkexec-to-get-root-
    rights.patch to support and handle --https-proxy option too. Dropbox
    now redirects the download URL to an https URL so it might be needed
    to get the download working in some situations.
  * Add display-error-string-when-download-failed.patch to provide more
    information when the download failed. It makes it easier to respond
    to user support requests.

nautilus-dropbox (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (without any change... just to increase
    the version number above the version that was in Ubuntu LTS).
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no change needed).

 -- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Mon, 09 Jul 2012 09:49:31 +0200

nautilus-dropbox (0.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update watch file to cope with changes on the dropbox website.
  * Update copyright file to fix 2 syntax errors and to add a disclaimer
    concerning the fact that the package is in non-free. Thanks
    to Charles Plessy for the patch. Closes: #650735
  * Split upstreamable changes from use-var-lib-dropbox.patch into
    do-not-hardcode-dropboxd-path.patch.
  * Split non-upstream changes from dropbox-update.patch into
    non-interactive-update.patch.
  * Update use-var-lib-dropbox.patch to ensure that the extracted files are
    owned by root.
  * Stop dropbox in the prerm and not in the postrm since the program
    is no longer available at that point.
  * New patch add-http-proxy-option.patch to force the http_proxy environment
    variable.
  * Update use-pkexec-to-get-root-rights.patch to forward the http_proxy
    environment variable across pkexec. Closes: #651065

nautilus-dropbox (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not touch /var/lib/update-notifier/dpkg-run-stamp as
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99update-notifier does it for us anyway at the end of
    the APT run. Manual installations of the package will not get the
    message but that's ok.
  * Drop /var/lib/update-notifier/user.d/dropbox-{re,}start-required
    on removal since we create them in the postinst and they
    might still be there if update-notifier is not installed.
    Closes: #648215
  * Drop fix-path-of-desktop-file.patch, applied upstream.
  * Refresh all other patches.

nautilus-dropbox (0.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the distribution in the changelog entry for version 0.7.0-1
    (UNRELEASED → unstable).

 -- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Oct 2011 16:28:59 +0200

nautilus-dropbox (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Drop use-system-rst2man.patch, merged upstream.
  * Refresh all other patches.
  * This version implements a GPG verification of the tarball
    downloaded from dropbox.com. Closes: #632771
    The wrapper needs python-gpgme to perform this check, so
    add it to the dependencies.
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 9 in order to benefit
    from the hardening build flags.
  * Use dh --with=python2 since previous change dropped usage of
    python-support.
  * Use -Wl,--as-needed to drop unnecessary libraries linked into the plugin.
    This requires dh-autoreconf's ability to patch ltmain.sh. Thus add
    it to the Build-Depends field.
  * New patch to remove files that will be overwritten by the unpack
    to avoid failures with ETXTBUSY. LP: #818014
  * New patch to ask for root rights when we have to install dropbox as
    user. LP: #821212
    Add dependency on policykit-1 since the patch makes use of pkexec.
  * Thanks to this, we don't have to ensure that the download succeeds
    in the postinst. LP: #876340
  * Update fix-path-of-desktop-file.patch to be upstreamable.

nautilus-dropbox (0.6.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Uses system's rst2man instead of the embedded one. Avoids a build
    failure once python-docutils 0.8 is uploaded. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.
    Closes: #639030

 -- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Wed, 07 Sep 2011 10:17:02 +0200

nautilus-dropbox (0.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Fix the watch file to not hardcode the version.

 -- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jul 2011 10:51:10 +0200

nautilus-dropbox (0.6.7-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a Suggests: nautilus.
  * Drop usage of https as urllib2 doesn't seem to correctly use the
    http proxy for https download. Upstream will soon provide GPG
    signatures so that this is not a big deal. Closes: #631300
  * Medium urgency to get the fixed version in testing.

 -- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Jun 2011 11:34:46 +0200

nautilus-dropbox (0.6.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add lintian override for the use of killall.
  * Include full license for CC-BY-ND.
  * Switch to HTTPS for the download, but we still have to implement
    HTTPS certificate validation.
  * Add the "XS-Autobuild: yes" header as per
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/11/msg00012.html

 -- Raphaël Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Thu, 09 Jun 2011 09:02:14 +0200

nautilus-dropbox (0.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. Closes: #544499, #613788
  * The package goes in non-free because the pictures are non-free (CC-BY-ND)
    even if the code is GPL. Otherwise it could have gone into contrib since
    it needs the proprietary dropbox binary to work.
  * Build the package only on i386 and amd64 since other architectures are not
    supported by Dropbox.
