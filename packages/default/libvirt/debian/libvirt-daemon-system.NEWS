libvirt (1.2.9~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  libvirtd now uses PolicyKit instead of unix socket domain permissions for r/w
  connections. This has the advantage of requiring less reconfiguration when
  using ACL based access and bringing us closer to upstream's recommendations.
  In order to keep old configurations working we're still allowing all members
  of the libvirt group full access via /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/60-libvirt.rules.

  If you want to continue to use socket permission based access control you can
  still configure it in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf.
