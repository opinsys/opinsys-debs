Description: programs for the libvirt library
 Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities
 of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). The library aims at providing
 a long term stable C API for different virtualization mechanisms. It currently
 supports QEMU, KVM, XEN, OpenVZ, LXC, and VirtualBox.
 .
 This package contains the supporting binaries to use with libvirt
