Subject: CVE-2014-8135: storage: fix crash caused by no check return before
 set close

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c5

When trying to use an invalid offset to virStorageVolUpload(), libvirt
fails in virFDStreamOpenFileInternal(), although it seems libvirt does
not check the return in storageVolUpload(), and calls
virFDStreamSetInternalCloseCb() right after.  But stream doesn't have a
privateData (is NULL) yet, and the daemon crashes then.
