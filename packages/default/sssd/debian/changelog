    - Add libsss-idmap0, libsss-idmap-dev packages
    - Add sssd Depends on libsss-idmap0
    - Add /var/lib/sss/mc directory for the new mmap cache
  * Split authentication providers to separate packages and make sssd
    a metapackage.
  * control: Drop libunistring-dev from build-depends and add libglib2.0-dev
    for unicode support.
  * sssd-*.install: Install new manpages.
  * python-sss.install: py-files got moved under SSSDConfig.
  * control, rules: Use default build flags, bump dpkg-dev build-dep to
    1.16.1~.
  * rules: Install the apparmor profile with -m644.
  * python-sss: Add pysss_murmur.so.

    - Add libndr-dev, libndr-standard-dev, libsamba-util-dev, samba4-dev,
      libdcerpc-dev to build-depends
    - Add -I/usr/include/samba-4.0 to CFLAGS
  * control: Mark sssd-common as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * watch: Add a comment about the upstream git tree.
  * Replace perl snippet from libnss-sss.post* with sed, drop perl from
    Depends. (Closes: #686237)
  * compat: Bump compat to 9.
  * rules: Set DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH, drop --libdir and remnants of cdbs.
  * sssd-common.install: Install the support binaries under the multiarch path.
  * rules,sssd-common.postinst: Move generate-config to /usr/share/sssd.
  * rules, sssd-common.install: Use the correct install path for the
    krb5_locator plugin.
  * libnss-sss.postinst: SSSD doesn't handle shadow maps, so don't pretend
    that it would.
  * libsss-sudo*, control: Remove the soname from the library, move .so to
    the libsss-sudo, drop -dev package.
  * rules: Pass --datadir, so the path in autogenerated python files is
    correctly substituted. (LP: #1079938)
  * sssd-krb5-common.dirs: Add krb5 include dir.
  * fix-cve-2013-0219*.diff, -0220.diff: Dropped, included upstream.
  * libsss-sudo.postrm: Run ldconfig on remove/purge.

    helper location (LP: #1175317).

    mode on install, and remove the profile directory on purge (if empty). Also
    migrate from previous setup which installed it as disabled.
    (Closes: #676140)
  * control: Bump policy to 3.9.4, no changes.
  * control: Add libpam-pwquality (>= 1.2.2-1) to libpam-sss depends, which
    makes the password stack work in all cases. (LP: #1159983)
  * control: Drop check from build-depends for now, to work around a linking bug
    in check (#712140) that makes the tests fail on (at least) i386.

  [ Stéphane Graber ]
  * Add postinst/postrm script for libsss-sudo. Those will add a "sudoers"
    entry to /etc/nsswitch.conf upon first installation of the package and
    will then take care of adding/removing sss from the stack as required.
  * Set CK_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT to 30 so that slower buildds (armhf at least) can
    run the tests without hitting the default 4s timeout.

      and python-libipa-hbac.
    - Split sssd-tools: add Breaks/Replaces sssd (<< 1.8.0~beta3-1) and
      add to sssd Suggests
  * Drop patch to ensure LDAP authentication never accept a zero
    length password, which is now included upstream.
  * sssd.upstart.ubuntu:
    - Don't start before net-device-up. (LP: 812943)
    - Source /etc/default/sssd. (LP: 812943)

  * Remove unnecessary libnss-sss.links.
  * libnss-sss.overrides: Add an override for

      (Closes: #595564).
    - Fix tight-loop bug on systems with older OpenLDAP client
      libraries (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5)
  * New Upstream Version 1.2.3:
    - Resolves CVE-2010-2940.
  * New Upstream Version 1.2.2:
    - The LDAP provider no longer requires access to the LDAP
      RootDSE. If it is unavailable, we will continue on with our best
      guess.
    - The LDAP provider will now log issues with TLS and GSSAPI to the
      syslog.
    - Significant performance improvement when performing initgroups
      on users who are members of large groups in LDAP.
    - The sss_client will now reconnect properly to the SSSD if the
      daemon is restarted.
      * This resolves an issue causing GDM to crash when logging out
        of a user after the SSSD had been restarted.
  * Correct package description for python-sss (Closes: #596215).
  * Update Standards-Version from 3.8.4 to 3.9.1.  No changes needed.

sssd (1.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure init.d script sources /etc/default/sssd (Closes: #588252).
  * Drop /etc/default/sssd from package, to avoid conffile question
    from dpkg during upgrades.
  * Make sure to only remove obsolete sssd conffiles on upgrades, not
    on first time installation.
  * Add new script generate-config and call it from the sssd postinst
    during first time installation to try to generate the sssd.conf
    file dynamically for LDAP and Kerberos using DNS entries, and fall
    back to the static example configuration if this fail.
  * Let sssd suggest libnss-sss and libpam-sss, to make those
    installing sssd aware of the other packages.
  * Add netgroup to nsswitch.conf entries added at first time
    installation, to make sure those installing now get working
    netgroups when sssd get netgroup support
  * Let sssd recommend ldap-utils as ldapsearch is used for generating
    the configuration.

sssd (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Move calls to pam-auth-update from the package scripts in sssd to
    libpam-sss, and correct prerm call to remove the correct pam config.
    Add versioned dependency on libpam-runtime to make sure
    pam-auth-update is available.
  * Add code to the postinst and postrm of libnss-sss to update
    passwd, group and shadow entries in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
  * Make sure init.d/sssd start after $named, to ensure it can look up
    in DNS also when the DNS server is on the local machine.

  [ Morten Werner Forsbring ]
  * New upstream release.

sssd (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Add libsemanage1-dev as build dependency, as it is now required.
    - Drop python-build-with-deb-layout.dpatch, now handled upstream.
    - Adjust provide-default-working-sssd-config-file.dpatch to
      work with new package source layout and config file content.
    - Adjust build rules to cope with server/ changing to src/ in the
      source tarball.
    - Add --enable-krb5-locator-plugin to keep building the plugin.
  * Change the pam-auth-update configuration to make the session
    script optional instead of sufficient, to make sure the other
    session modules are executed too.
  * Change initial pam password entry from requisite to sufficient,
    to make sure local users can have their password set even if
    sssd is enabled.
  * Rename pam-configs/sssd to pam-configs/sss, to have a name that
    is consistent with the package name libpam-sss.
  * Add VCS links to the GIT repository.
  * Move configuration API documentation from /etc/sssd/ to
    /usr/share/doc/sssd/.  It is not configuration and do not belong
    in /etc/.
  * Drop autoconf, automake, libtool, m4 and autotools-dev from
    build-depends.  There is no need to regenerate the build files any
    more.

  [ Morten Werner Forsbring ]
  * Add dnsutils as build-dependency.
