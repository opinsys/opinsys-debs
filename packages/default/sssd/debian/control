Description: System Security Services Daemon -- metapackage
 Provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and
 authentication mechanisms. It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward
 the system and a pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different
 account sources. It is also the basis to provide client auditing and policy
 services for projects like FreeIPA.
