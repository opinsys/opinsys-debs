Description: userspace virtual filesystem - GIO module
 gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem where mounts run as separate
 processes which you talk to via D-Bus. It also contains a gio module
 that seamlessly adds gvfs support to all applications using the gio
 API. It also supports exposing the gvfs mounts to non-gio applications
 using fuse.
