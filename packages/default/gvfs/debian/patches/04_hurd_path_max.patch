Subject: [PATCH] volume monitors: on glibc systems, let realpath() allocate
 its own buffer
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This was originally to support Hurd, which doesn't have a PATH_MAX
at all. It also seems a good idea for systems where PATH_MAX is just a
convenient lie, such as Linux.

Based on a patch by Samuel Thibault, as revised by Martin Pitt,
RaphaÃ«l Hertzog and Emilio Pozuelo Monfort.
