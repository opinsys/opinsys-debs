Description: Remote desktop/application/thin-client server core features
 NX is a software suite from NoMachine which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 This package contains a free (GPL) implementation of the nxserver component.
