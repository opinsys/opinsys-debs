README file for seabios/debian/optionrom

The files in this directory are taken from qemu sources,
git commits below.  They're from qemu and used by qemu,
but are packaged with seabios, because the files must
be built on x86 arch (just like seabios itself) but are
Arch: all.  Seabios package itself is Arch: all, so it
has no issues building some more stuff with it.  But
qemu is Arch: any, but the only architecture where these
files can be built is x86.  So we just move them into
seabios package and build here.

The files taken from qemu:
