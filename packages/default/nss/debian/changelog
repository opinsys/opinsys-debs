  * debian/control, debian/libnss3*, debian/rules,
    mozilla/security/coreconf/*, mozilla/security/nss/lib/*/manifest.mn:
    Move to unversioned library. ABI compatibility is ensured upstream, and
    the SO version, if it needed a change at any time, would be a change in
    the library name. There is no reason to keep making compatibility more
    difficult with other distros and upstream binary releases. While previous
    versions were one-way compatible (binaries built against other distros or
    upstream nspr could work on Debian), this approach works both ways.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.0. No changes required.
    - Force to build against libnspr4-dev >= 2:4.9
  * Removed unapplied patches.
  * Adding an epoch to match the old libnss3 package that used to be in
