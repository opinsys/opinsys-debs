  * debian/rules, debian/shlibs.local: Call dh_makeshlibs for libgnome-

    there to workaround dpkg-dev setting ignoring the dependency from
    the Depends line and using that of dpkg-shlibdeps, but it's no
    longer the case. As a side effect, this makes the shlibs
    file be versioned as it should be.
