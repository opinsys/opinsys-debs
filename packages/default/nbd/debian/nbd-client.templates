Template: nbd-client/no-auto-config
Type: error
_Description: AUTO_GEN is set to "n" in /etc/nbd-client
 The /etc/nbd-client file contains a line that sets the AUTO_GEN variable
 to "n". The file will therefore not be regenerated automatically.
 .
 If that's wrong, remove the line and call "dpkg-reconfigure nbd-client"
 afterwards.

Template: nbd-client/number
Type: string
Default: 0
_Description: Number of nbd-client connections to use:
 nbd-client can handle multiple concurrent connections. Please specify the
 number of connections you'd like this configuration script to set up.
 .
 Note that if something has already been specified in /etc/nbd-client, the
 current configuration will be used as defaults in these dialogs.

Template: nbd-client/type
Type: select
_Choices: swap, filesystem, raw
Default: raw
_Description: Intended use of the network block device number ${number}:
 The network block device can serve multiple purposes. One of the most
 interesting is to provide swap space over the network for diskless clients,
 but you can store a filesystem on it, or do other things with it for which
 a block device is interesting.
 .
 If you intend to use the network block device as a swap device, choose
 "swap". If you intend to use it as a filesystem, add a line to /etc/fstab,
 give it the option "_netdev" (else init will try to mount it before it's
 usable), and choose "filesystem". For all other purposes, choose "raw".
 The only thing the nbd-client boot script will do then is start an
 nbd-client process; you will have to set it up manually.

Template: nbd-client/host
Type: string
_Description: Hostname of the server (number: ${number})?
 Please enter the network name or IP address of the machine on which
 the nbd-server process is running.

Template: nbd-client/port
Type: string
_Description: Port or name for nbd export (number: ${number})?
 Please enter the TCP port number or NBD export name needed to access
 nbd-server.
 .
 Versions of nbd-server of 2.9.16 or lower did not support specifying a
 name for the NBD export. If your NBD server is of an older version, you
 should enter the TCP port number here, and should make sure not to
 enter any non-numeric characters in the field.
 .
 More recent versions of nbd-server support providing a name for an
 export. If the data entered in this field contains any non-numeric
 characters, then this configuration system will accept that as a name
 and provide it to nbd-client as a name-based export rather than a
 port-based one.

Template: nbd-client/device
Type: string
_Description: /dev entry for this nbd-client (number: ${number})?
 Every nbd-client process needs to be associated with a /dev entry with
 major number 43. Please enter the name of the /dev entry you want to use for
 this nbd-client. Note that this needs to be the full path to that entry,
 not just the last part.
 .
 If the /dev entry specified does not exist, it will be created with minor
 number ${number}.

Template: nbd-client/killall
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Disconnect all NBD devices on "stop"?
 When the nbd-client init script is called to stop the nbd-client service,
 there are two things that can be done: either it can disconnect all
 nbd-client devices (which are assumed not to be in use), or it can
 disconnect only those nbd-client devices that it knows about in its
 config file.
 .
 The default (and the traditional behavior) is to disconnect all
 nbd-client devices. If the root device or other critical file systems
 are on NBD this will cause data loss and should not be accepted.

Template: nbd-client/extra
Type: string
_Description: Extra parameters (number: ${number})
 If you wish to add any extra parameters to nbd-client, then please
 enter them here.
