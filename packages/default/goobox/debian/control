Description: CD player and ripper with GNOME 3 integration
 Goobox is an CD player and ripper for the GNOME 3 environment. It follows the 
 "Just Works" principle so its interface is beautiful and easy-to-use.
 .
 It uses GNOME/GTK+ for its user interface, GStreamer framework for CD playing,
 and ripping operations, musicbrainz for CD indexing, and Google to search
 for album cover images.
