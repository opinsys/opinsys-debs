Package: libpwquality-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         libpwquality1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Password quality checking and generation (development files)
 libpwquality's purpose is to provide common functions for password
 quality checking and also scoring them based on their apparent randomness. The
 library also provides a function for generating random passwords with good
 pronounceability.
 .
 This package contains the development files, and should be used for
 compilation.

 This module can be plugged into the password stack of a given service to
 provide some plug-in strength-checking for passwords. The code was originaly
 based on pam_cracklib module and the module is backwards compatible with its
 options.
