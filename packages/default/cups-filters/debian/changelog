    - foomatic-rip: Do not use PATH_MAX for the length of static strings
      which are supposed to hold a command line. Use our own CMDLINE_MAX

cups-filters (1.0.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.0.44

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Split binary package "cups-filters" into "cups-filters" and
    "cups-filters-core-drivers". In low-footprint (mobile) environments we
    can restrict the printer support to only IPP printers with known
    common languages (PDF, PostScript, PWG Raster, PCL) to get rid of
    the heavy load of drivers and PPDs for thousands of printers. From
    cups-filters we need only the "cups-browsed" and
    "cups-filters-core-drivers" (plus library packages) then and with
    "cups-daemon" and "cups-core-drivers" from CUPS and "poppler-utils"
    and "libpoppler" from Poppler one gets a low-footprint printing stack
    for mobile devices setting up IPP printers automatically (Needs
    "CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes" in cups-browsed.conf).
  * AppArmor profile: Allow reading and writing in /tmp/ as cups-browsed
    creates temporary files when setting up native IPP printers PPD-less
    ("CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes" in cups-browsed.conf).

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Strip UNRELEASED 1.0.39-1 changelog entry (Closes: #733981)
  * Drop update-rc.d arguments in Debian, as they are no longer
    supported

    - pdftopdf: Fixed software copy generation logic for printers
      with hardware copy generation, but without collate support
      (LP: #1259240).
    - pstopdf: Support for the "landscape" and
      "orientation-requested" options (LP: #1243484).
  * Drop all patches:
    - PATH_MAX fix was from upstream;
    - The Fedora fix for PDF landscape printing got included
      differently.
  * Update debian/watch to prefer .xz tarballs
  * Install manpages for cups-browsed and foomatic-rip

    (Closes: #731611)
  * Add Debian-specific more lightweight default testpage in svg;
    convert it at build-time with rsvg-convert, hence add librsvg2-bin
    in Build-Depends. Thanks to Stefan Nagy (Closes: #718895)
  * Make all Ubuntu derivatives use Ubuntu material through dpkg-vendor
    --derives-from instead of --is
  * Backport upstream patch to fix kFreeBSD FTBFS due to conflicting
    PATH_MAX defintions. Thanks to Peter Green (Closes: #731658)

cups-filters (1.0.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.0.42:
     - cupsfilters.convs: Corrected cost factor of
       vnd.cups-postscript -> vnd.cups-raster conversion with
       gstoraster, so that input data of the type
       application/vnd.adobe-reader-postscript is converted
       correctly (not via pstotiff). Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red
       Hat for this patch
     - cups-browsed: Fixed several memory leaks by adding missing
       free() calls and removing an unneeded strdup(). Thanks to
       Jaromir Koncicky from Red Hat for the patch (Red Hat bug
       #1027317).
     - foomatic-rip: Moved foomatic-rip's upstream home from the
       foomatic-filters package to cups-filters, to make it easier
       for distributions to ship and maintain a complete printing
       stack and also to make upstream maintenance and development
       easier.
     - gstoraster: Fixed build system for gstoraster use D-Bus for
       colord support.

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Drop patches included upstream:
    - Include dbus to make sure colord support works; therefore add
      libdbus-1-dev in Build-Depends
    - Fix memory leaks in cups-browsed
    - Adjust filter costs so application/vnd.adobe-read-postscript input
      doesn't go via pstotiff
  * Updated libcupsfilters1 symbols for 1.0.42
  * Add "Conflicts/Replaces/Provides: foomatic-filters" for the
    cups-filters binary package. Now foomatic-rip is part of
    cups-filters and the foomatic-filters package is obsolete and should
    get automatically uninstalled by the cups-filters binary package.

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Move packaging from bzr to git
    - Drop .bzr-builddeb
    - Update Vcs-* fields
  * Drop conflicting Recommends against foomatic-filters
  * Rename ttf-dejavu dependency to fonts-dejavu (Closes: #716744)

cups-filters (1.0.41-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.0.41:
     - pdftops: Introduced new "hybrid" renderer: Here usually
       Ghostscript is used, but if the printer is a Brother,
       Minolta, or Konica Minolta Poppler's pdftops gets used. This
       is a quirk rule to work around bugs in the PS interpreters
       of the printers (LP: #1097105, LP: #1053443, LP: #1205898, LP: #238129,
       LP: #1072915, LP: #293832).
     - cups-browsed: Assure that it always applies to the local CUPS
       daemon and never to a remote one specified via client.conf
       (LP: #1207203).
     - pdftops: If one or more of the PDF-to-PS renderers (Ghostscript,
       Poppler pdftops, Poppler pdftocairo, acroread) is not installed
       at build time, pre-fill the appropriate executable's path with the
       executable name to allow the use of this renderer when it gets
       installed later (Closes: #716842).
     - Added man pages for cups-browsed and cups-browsed.conf. Thanks to
       Brian Potkin for the contribution (Closes: #714460).
     - pdftops: Let Poppler generally generate PostScript level 3 if the
       PPD identifies the printer as PS3 printer, make an exception of
       sending PostScript Level 2 only for HP's laser printers, to not
       compromise print quality and performance on all PS3 printers only
       due to some buggy HP models (Closes: #712949, see also LP: #277404).

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Added Conflicts/Provides/Replaces and droppded Recommends/Breaks against
    ghostscript-cups to the cups-filters binary package as all files from
    ghostscript-cups moved to cups-filters (LP: #1212239).
  * debian/libcupsfilters1.symbols: Updated for 1.0.36
  * debian/rules: Removed "--with-browseremoteprotocols=dnssd" from the
    ./configure command line, we use the upstream default "dnssd,cups"
    now.
  * debian/rules: Added ./configure option "--with-pdftops=hybrid" to activate
    the hybrid rendering mode (LP: #1097105, LP: #1053443, LP: #1205898,
    LP: #238129, LP: #1072915, LP: #293832).

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Install escp.h and pcl.h in the CUPS ppdc include directory; this
    fixes cupsfilters.drv.
  * In cups-browsed's postinst:
    - Drop useless uses of cat
    - Handle upgrade of Browse{Remote,Local}Protocols from cups < 1.6
  * Make cups-browsed break cups-daemon << 1.6.4 to make sure the above
    upgrade is left possible

cups-filters (1.0.34-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * In cups-browsed:
    - move cups from Depends to Enhances, also drop it from the init
      script requirements; it is not strictly necessary for cups-browsed
      to function.
    - add avahi-daemon to Depends, it is needed for the daemon to
      actually start. This will also transitively bring libnss-mdns in
      the normal cases as it is a recommends of avahi-daemon.
      (Closes: #711319, #711229)
    - in postinst, only try to import cups changes if the configuration
      file exists.
    - make the long description clearer on the situations in which it is
      useful. (Closes: #698141)

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * debian/local/cups-browsed.upstart: Give up starting cups-browsed after

cups-filters (1.0.34-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release 1.0.33:
     - cups-browsed: Added NULL check (Upstream bug #1106).
  * New upstream bug fix release 1.0.34:
     - pdftopdf: Fixed duplex printing logic. Before when printing
       duplex jobs with multiple copies and a odd number of pages,
       the first page of the second copy got onto the back side of
       the last page of the first copy, rendering printing more than
       one copy unusable.
     - cups-browsed: If a queue left over from the last session
       gets confirmed, fill in the data structure with the Bonjour
       parameters, also update the Bonjour parameters if a local
       queue is upgraded from IPP to IPPS.

cups-filters (1.0.32-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release
     - cups-browsed: Shared algorithm to generate local queues based on
       browsed remote queue data between Bonjour and CUPS browsing, as the
       simpler method used for CUPS browsing could overwrite local print
       queues and had de-duplication problems, for example if the server
       appears on two IPs in the network (connected by both ethernet and
       WLAN).
     - cups-browsed: CUPS broadcasting also broadcasted non-shared,
       especially cups-browsed-generated printers. Switched to detection
       of non-shared printers by the appropriate bit in the printer-type
       bit field IPP attribute.
     - cups-browsed: Made CUPS broadcasting work also without BrowseAllow
       lines in cups-browsed.conf. In this case we accept all remote
       printers (LP: #1163764).
     - README: Updated documentation for cups-browsed.
     - Added more comments and examples to /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf.
     - cups-browsed: Added support for "...:<port>" extensions of
       BrowsePoll addresses. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat
       (LP: #1159213).

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Let cups-browsed overtake browsing-related directives from
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf into /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf. Comment out
    directives which introduce CUPS broadcasting/browsing so that users
    use this deprecated method only if absolutely necessary. Add
    comments to tell the user about how to use the added lines.
    (LP: #1159213)

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Use the new fonts-freefont-ttf package name
  * Add simple cups-browsed init script (Closes: #700929)

cups-filters (1.0.31-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - cups-browsed: cups-browsed removed valid local queues pointing to
       remote queues when cups-browsed did not shut down cleanly after
       the previous session, leaving the user with missing local accessor
       queues for some of the remote CUPS queues (LP: #1131149).
     - pdftopdf: Improved error output.
     - pdftopdf: getRotation now handles unusual cases more graceful
       (LP: #1154318).
     - cups-browsed: Do not remove a generated local print queue when
       it was made the system default printer (LP: #1146407).
     - texttopdf: Fixed corrupted pdf when a utf-8 title is given and
       corresponding crash with 'prettyprint' (LP: #1137438).
     - cups-browsed: Added CUPS Broadcasting for sharing local printers
       to remote CUPS clients with CUPS 1.5.x and older. Thanks to Tim
       Waugh from Red Hat.
     - cups-browsed: Added sample config-file and build-time default
       setting options. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat.
     - cups-browsed: Added CUPS browsing and BrowsePoll functionality, to
       be backwards compatible to CUPS 1.5.x and older servers. Thanks
       to Tim Waugh from Red Hat.
     - pdftopdf: Fixed incorrect evenDuplex page insertion (Upstream bug #1088).
     - pdftoopvp: Let it build with Poppler 0.22.x. Thanks to Koji Otani
       from BBR Inc. (Upstream bug #1089).

     - cups-browsed: Added daemon to browse the Bonjour broadcasts of
       shared remote CUPS printers and automatically add local raw queues
       pointing to them, to resemble the behavior of the former CUPS
       broadcasting/browsing which was dropped in CUPS 1.6. Now remote

cups-filters (1.0.20-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Added another workaround for Kyocera printers: Some
       models get very slow on images which request interpolation,
       so now we remove the image interpolation requests by additional
       PostScript code only inserted for Kyocera printers (LP: #1026974).
     - Made the Poppler-based filters pdftopdf and pdftoopvp build with
       both Poppler 0.18.x and 0.20.x (Upstream bug #1055).
     - Fixes according to Coverity scan results (Upstream bug #1054).
     - Switched build system to autotools. This especially fixes several
       build problems in Gentoo. Also build-tested with CUPS 1.6.0b1.
     - Fixes for compatibility with clang/gcc-4.7.
     - textonly: Filter did not work as a pipe with copies=1 (Upstream bug
       #1032).
     - texttopdf: Avoid trimming the results of FcFontSort(), as this may
       miss some reasonable candidates under certain circumstances. BTW,
       fix passing a non-pointer as a pointer to "result" (Closes: #670055).
     - Corrected documentation. The option for the maximum image rendering
       resolution in pdftops is "pdftops-max-image-resolution", not
       "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default".
  * debian/patches/fcfontsort-no-trim.patch: Removed, fixed upstream.
  * debian/rules: Updated options for ./configure and make for the new autotools
    build system.
  * debian/watch: Switched to bz2 upstream packages.
  * debian/rules, debian/copyright, debian/cups-filters.docs: Updated for
    renamed documentation files.
  * debian/control, debian/libfontembed1.install,
    debian/libfontembed-dev.install: Added new binary packages for libfontembed.
  * debian/copyright: Updated for recent file additions, and rearrangement of
    directories.
  * debian/control: Added missing build dependency on libpoppler-cpp-dev.
  * debian/copyright: Corrections (Closes: #682752).

cups-filters (1.0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Allow selection whether Ghostscript or Poppler is used
       at runtime, setting the "pdftops-renderer" option to "gs" or
       "pdftops". This way one can switch to Poppler per-queue if there
       are incompatibilities with certain PostScript printers.
     - pdftops: Allow setting an upper limit for the image rendering
       resolution, also at runtime, setting the option
       "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default" to the desired limit in dpi.
       "0" means no limit. Default limit is 1440 dpi. This prevents slow
       processing by the printer if very high resolutions are used or
       if the printing resolution is mis-detected by the pdftops filter.
     - pdftops: Fixed crash by wrong usage of sizeof() function when adding
       "Collate" to the fifth command line argument for the "pstops" CUPS
       filter call (LP: #982675).
     - pdftops: Removed newline from copies value when reading it from
       the "%%PDFTOPDFNumCopies" entry of the incoming PDF file.
     - pdftops: Silenced compiler warning about ignoring the return
       value of the write() function.
     - pdftops: Added a crash guard.
     - pdftops: Start determining the printing resolution with
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD(), this is the most reliable as often
       the choice names of the "Resolution" option are marketing names
       with higher numerical values than the actual resolution. Also
       ignore error exit values of cupsRasterInterpretPPD() as the
       function can error out after having found the resolution.
     - pdftops: If printing resolution is determined by
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD() do not stick on 100 dpi if the
       resolution cannot be determined (LP: #984082).
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation fault when printing selected pages
       ("page-ranges" option, LP: #980673).

cups-filters (1.0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation faults when using N-up with certain PDF
       files (LP: #980673) and when calling pdftopdf manually without
       specifyting a PPD file.
     - pdftops: Suppress image compression only for Brother printers as they
       really need this measure to print at all. This accelerates printer-
       internal job processing on most other printers (tested on HP and
       Kyocera). Also suppress page compression on Kyocera printers, this
       works around a bug in Kyocera's PostScript interpreters which makes
       printing pages with images very slow (LP: #977912).
     - pdftops: Determine printing resolution from the PPD file and supply
       it on the Ghostscript or pdftops (Poppler) command line, so that
       the renderer does the image rendering with a resolution matching the
       printer's resolution. This avoids too slow processing of the jobs
       by the printer's built-in PostScript interpreter. In addition
       a default resolution of 300 dpi is used for PPDs without any hint
       of the printer's resolution, as most PostScript lasers use multiples
       of 300 dpi as resolution (LP: #977912).

cups-filters (1.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - Updated all code copied from Poppler to the current state of Poppler,
       to fix any bugs or security vulnerabilities which were in that
       Poppler code.
     - Made Poppler-based PDF filters building with various versions of
       Poppler.
     - Deactivated MIME conversion rules which are not used by the PDF-
       based printing workflow.
     - Added generic PPD for native PDF printers.
     - Cleaned up sample PPD file HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
     - imagetopdf: Added support for native PDF printers.
     - imagetopdf, imagetoraster: Let image input "scale to fit"
       by default. This makes photo printing via AirPrint work,
       as the iOS devices send JPEG but do not allow setting options.
     - pdftops: Generally do not compress fonts and images, and
       also do not do CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs to make
       the PostScript output more compatible with buggy PostScript
       interpreters. The output gets 30-50% longer but will work on
       many more different printer models. Problems were also
       discovered on HP and not only on Brother (LP: #960666).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Drop debian/patches/poppler-pre-0.18.patch and patch machinery around it.

cups-filters (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - cups-filters 1.0.7 release
     - pdftops: Added debug mode for investigating PostScript printer
       incompatibilities and interpreter bugs. Now sending a job with
       "lpr -o psdebug" makes the filter sending uncompressed PostScript.
     - pdftops: Additional workaround for a bug in the PostsSript interpreters
       of Brother printers, calling Ghostscript with special command line
       options (LP: #955553).
     - pdftopdf: Correct handling of PJL output and page_log messages on
       native PDF printers and on printers using a driver after pdftopdf
       (including PostScript printers).
     - texttopdf: Full fontconfig support, several bug fixes and improvements
       to make the output work on more different PDF interpreters, including
       built-in interpreters in printers.
     - Fixed cupsfilters.drv PPD generator and rastertopclx filter to make the
       supported HP DesignJet printers actually work.
     - parallel backend: Use same method as CUPS to overcome infinite loop
       on side channel errors (LP: #936647, CUPS STR #4044).
     - "make clean" and "make distclesn" work also correctly now when called
       repeatedly (Closes: #663564).

      (LP: #939735).
    - bannertopdf: Output multiple copies of the test page if duplex
      and/or N-up is chosen, to let the test page appear on all possible
      positions of the sheet (LP: #939530).
    - bannertopdf: Scale test page template to fit the job's page size,
      get and display full page geometry information, draw the frame which
      marks the printable area 1pt smaller, to assure that it gets completely
      visible (LP: #921073).
  * debian/local/default-testpage.pdf: Added missing "Q" operator to the end of
    the page. This broke N-up printing with pdftopdf (LP: #939530).
  * debian/control: Added explicit build dependency on libfontconfig1-dev.
    (Closes: #661127)
  * debian/control: Changed font dependency (for texttopdf) to "ttf-freefont |
    fonts-liberation | ttf-dejavu" instead of only "ttf-freefont"
    (Closes: #495598, Closes: #662660).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/control: Build against libpng-dev, with an alternative to the older
    libpng12-dev. (Closes: #662295)
  * debian/control: Prefer building against libtiff5-dev if available, falling  
    back to libtiff-dev.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Move from hardening-wrapper to using
