Description: Processing
 Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online
 community.  Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within
 the visual arts and visual literacy within technology.  Initially created
 to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming
 fundamentals within a visual context, Processing evolved into a development
 tool for professionals.  Today, there are tens of thousands of students,
 artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for
 learning, prototyping, and production.
