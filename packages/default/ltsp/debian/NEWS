ltsp (5.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    ltsp-build-client plugins now create an appropriate entry in 
    /etc/ltsp/ltsp-update-image.conf to disable ltsp-update-image from 
    switching to an NBD configuration simply by running ltsp-update-image. If 
    you would like to switch to NBD after creating the image, you'll need to 
    edit ltsp-update-image.conf appropriately.

ltsp (5.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    With the 5.3.x series, Debian LTSP now defaults to making the thin 
    client's root filesystem writeable with an aufs overlay with tmpfs, rather
    than the old method of bind mounts from a tmpfs filesystem. This obviates
    the need or usefulness of the old LTSP_RW_DIRS, LTSP_COPY_DIRS, and 
    LTSP_BINDFILES lts.conf variables.

ltsp (0.99debian8) unstable; urgency=low

    architecture handling code has been simplified. now all architectures
    default to installing the same architecture running on the server. you
    change change this by passing --arch ARCH to ltsp-build-client, but will
    only work for certain server and ltsp client combinations. see
    /usr/share/doc/ltsp-server/README.Debian for more information.

ltsp (0.99debian6) unstable; urgency=low

    It is now required to set NBD_SWAP=Y instead of setting NBD_PORT in
    /opt/ltsp/ARCH/etc/lts.conf.  Only set NBD_PORT if a non-default value is
    needed. see /usr/share/doc/ltsp-server/swap for more complete
    documentation.
