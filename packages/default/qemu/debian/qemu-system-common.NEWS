qemu (2.0.0~rc1+dfsg-2exp) experimental; urgency=low

qemu-system-* packages does not provide /usr/bin/qemu alternative
anymore, and all various alternatives will be unregistered at new
individual qemu-system packages install.  This is because different
architectures are not really alternatives, and never has been.
Historically, qemu emulated just one architecture, so the name "qemu"
was used for the binary.  However when more architectures were added,
the old name "qemu" was used as an alternative, pointing to one of
the emulators.  Upstream does not use the name "qemu" for binaries
for a long time.  If you have scripts using the old name "qemu"
please update them to use the right qemu-system-* binary.
