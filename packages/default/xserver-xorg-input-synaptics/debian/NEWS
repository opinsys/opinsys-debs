xserver-xorg-input-synaptics (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * All the shared memory code has been removed from synclient and syndaemon.
    The SHMConfig option is still available but the only use is for monitoring
    the hardware state data.
    If you have any script that changes the synaptics driver configuration
    make sure that you don't use the -s option to synclient.

xserver-xorg-input-synaptics (1.1.1~git20090510-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tapping has been disabled by default on many touchpads by upstream, see
    the "NOTES" section in the synaptics(4) manpage for a short overview
    about how defaults are calculated.
    If you want to re-enable it, you can do so from within the X
    environment by running the following commands in a terminal:

        $ synclient TapButton1=1
        $ synclient TapButton2=2
        $ synclient TapButton3=3

    Note that the configuration will not be permanently modified, to do
    so assign the above option values in your xorg.conf (see the synaptics(4)
    manpage or the documents in /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
    for additional details).  Another alternative is to use desktop
    environment specific tools like gpointing-device-settings or touchfreeze.
