jq (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #725118)
  * Add a new patch that enables the creation of the manpage.
  * Add a new patch that disables valgrind on certain architectures
    reported as failing (because of missing valgrind support) by buildd
  * Remove a patch fixing destination directories (resolved by the
    automake toolchain used in this release).
  * Use github.com directly to check for new releases instead of the
    githubredir.debian.net services (as stated in uscan(1)).
  * Thanks to Faidon Liambotis and Michael Stapelberg for their extensive
    reviews.
