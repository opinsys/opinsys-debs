vtun for Debian
---------------

The installed /etc/vtund.conf file is empty except for explanatory comments.

By default, vtund doesn't start at all, you need to edit /etc/vtund.conf
and set it up for your requirements. See the docs and examples for details.

You also need to edit /etc/default/vtun and define whether vtund is
being run as a client, as a server or both.
