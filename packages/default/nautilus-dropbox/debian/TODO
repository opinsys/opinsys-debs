* Find out why the dropbox icon is not properly displayed in gnome-shell.
  I would expect the issue to affect other menus (the traditional
  menus in gnome for instance, but I have not verified)

* Update debian/patches/download-via-https.patch to actually validate
  the HTTPS certificate. The patch description contains a link with some
  documentation on how this can be done.

* Provide some introductory documentation in README.Debian. It
  should notably explain that you can do "dropbox autostart" to make it
  automatically start when you login.
