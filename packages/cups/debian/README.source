cups packaging for Debian
-------------------------

cups is maintained with git-buildpackage on git.debian.org (see Vcs-Git: control
field). git-buildpackage is documented at /usr/share/doc/git-buildpackage/ (in
particular the comprehensive manual-html/).

It uses a standard 3.0 (quilt) patch system.

The really short path to get a buildable source tree is:

  debcheckout cups
  cd cups
  quilt push -af
