cups-filters (1.0.40-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release 1.0.40:
     - pdftops: Introduced new "hybrid" renderer: Here usually
       Ghostscript is used, but if the printer is a Brother,
       Minolta, or Konica Minolta Poppler's pdftops gets used. This
       is a quirk rule to work around bugs in the PS interpreters
       of the printers (LP: #1097105, LP: #1053443, LP: #1205898, LP: #238129,
       LP: #1072915, LP: #293832).
     - Fixed format string issues and added __attribute__ wording
       to printf-like functions to catch any regressions. Thanks to
       Tim Waugh from Red Hat for the patch.
     - pdftops: Fix for landscape PDF handling. Do not use the
       command line options "-origpagesizes" and
       "-choosePaperByPDFPageSize" of Poppler's pdftops utility on
       already processed PDF data. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat
       for the patch.
     - cups-browsed: Improve the efficiency of BrowsePoll by using
       IPP notifications when possible. It falls back to the
       previous behaviour if it is not possible to use this
       optimization. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat for the patch.
  * pdftops-only-use-origpagesizes-on-unprocessed-PDFs.patch: Removed patch
    backported from upstream.
  * debian/rules: Added ./configure option "--with-pdftops=hybrid" to activate
    the hybrid rendering mode (LP: #1097105, LP: #1053443, LP: #1205898,
    LP: #238129, LP: #1072915, LP: #293832).

  * New upstream release 1.0.37:
     - Added example configuration files for systemd and Upstart. Thanks
       to Tomáš Chvátal for the systemd file.
     - Build system: Make sure that gstoraster gets linked against the
       libcupsfilters of the currently built package and not of the
       system. Thanks to Tomáš Chvátal.
     - cupsfilters.convs: Reworked the cost factors of the filters to
       avoid bogus filter chains like pstotiff|imagetopdf instead of
       pstopdf|pdftopdf for PostScript->PDF. Thanks to Tim Waugh from
       Red Hat for the report.
     - pdftopdf: Accept additional command line options for PPD-less
       printing.
     - cups-browsed: Fixed building with CUPS 1.5.x and older,
       ippSetVersion() was missing under the accessor function definitions
       for backward compatibility.

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release 1.0.36:
     - Fixed libdl detection in configure. Thanks to Andreas Huettel and
       Yuta Satoh (Gentoo bug #478642).
     - cups-browsed: Allow BrowsePoll operation also access print queues
       on older CUPS servers. Thanks to David Mohr for the patch.
     - cups-browsed: Assure that it always applies to the local CUPS
       daemon and never to a remote one specified via client.conf
       (LP: #1207203).
     - pdftoopvp, pdftoijs, pdftoraster, bannertopdf: Made code working
       with Poppler 0.24.x (Upstream bug #1144).
     - gstoraster: Silenced compiler warnings.
     - gstoraster, pdftoraster: Added support for PPD-less printing
       controlled by IPP attributes (CUPS 1.7.x+ only).
     - gstoraster, gstopxl: Moved these filters from Ghostscript to
       cups-filters as upstream home.
     - libcupsfilters: Added new cupsRasterParseIPPOptions() API
       function for PPD-less printing controlled by IPP attributes
       (raster.h, CUPS 1.7.x+ only).
     - pdftopdf: Added support for page labels. "page-label" option and
       "CLASSIFICATION" environment variable. Thanks to Tim Waugh from
       Red Hat for the patch.
     - pdftops: If one or more of the PDF-to-PS renderers (Ghostscript,
       Poppler pdftops, Poppler pdftocairo, acroread) is not installed
       at build time, pre-fill the appropriate executable's path with the
       executable name to allow the use of this renderer when it gets
       installed later (Closes: #716842).
     - cups-browsed: Do not resolve host names of remote printers discovered
       via CUPS broadcasts (Upstream bug #1141).
     - Added man pages for cups-browsed and cups-browsed.conf. Thanks to
       Brian Potkin for the contribution (Closes: #714460).
     - Install also escp.h, it is useful for .drv files.
  * New upstream release 1.0.35:
     - pdftoraster: Silenced compiler warning (Upstream bug #1092).
     - bannertopdf: Fixed typo which prevented the host name to be shown
       (Upstream bug #1115).
     - README: Fixed info about the PPD keyword cupsManualCopies (Upstream bug
       #1086).
     - Modified the cost factors of the filters to avoid unneeded PDF
       conversion detours when the input data is PostScript. Instead of
       pstopdf->pdftopdf->pdftops and pstopdf->pdftopdf->gstoraster we
       get pstops and pstops->gstoraster now (Upstream bug #1138).
     - pdftops: Added experimental support for pdftocairo as PDF renderer.
       Note that PostScript level 1 output and PDF input with color
       spaces other than DeviceRGB, DeviceGray, sRGB or sGray is not
       supported. PDFs generated by Cairo (for example when printing from
       evince) uses only supported color spaces. Thanks to James Cloos
       for the patch (Upstream bug #1139).
     - cups-browsed: Changed default of browsing protocols fron none to
       both DNS-SD and CUPS.
     - pdftops: Let Poppler generally generate PostScript level 3 if the
       PPD identifies the printer as PS3 printer, make an exception of
       sending PostScript Level 2 only for HP's laser printers, to not
       compromise print quality and performance on all PS3 printers only
       due to some buggy HP models (Closes: #712949, see also LP: #277404).
     - Install pcl.h, it is needed by cupsfilters.drv. Thanks to Jiri
       Popelka from Red Hat for the patch (Upstream bug #1133).
     - Make cups-filters building with automake 1.13. Thanks to Andreas K.
       Huettel (dilfridge) on IRC.
     - libcupsfilters, libfontembed, pdftopdf, texttopdf, cups-browsed:
       Fixed several resource leaks and other problems. Thanks to Jiri
       Popelka from Red Hat for the patches (Upstream bug #1116).
  * debian/control: Added "Conflicts/Provides/Replaces: ghostscript-cups"
    to the cups-filters binary package as all files from ghostscript-cups
    moved to cups-filters.
  * debian/libcupsfilters1.symbols: Updated.
  * debian/rules: Removed "--with-browseremoteprotocols=dnssd" from the
    ./configure command line, we use the upstream default "dnssd,cups"
    now.

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Install escp.h and pcl.h in the CUPS ppdc include directory; this
    fixes cupsfilters.drv.

  * In cups-browsed:
    - move cups from Depends to Enhances, also drop it from the init
      script requirements; it is not strictly necessary for cups-browsed
      to function.
    - add avahi-daemon to Depends, it is needed for the daemon to
      actually start. This will also transitively bring libnss-mdns in
      the normal cases as it is a recommends of avahi-daemon.

  * New upstream bug fix release 1.0.33:
     - cups-browsed: Added NULL check (Upstream bug #1106).
  * New upstream bug fix release 1.0.34:
     - pdftopdf: Fixed duplex printing logic. Before when printing
       duplex jobs with multiple copies and a odd number of pages,
       the first page of the second copy got onto the back side of
       the last page of the first copy, rendering printing more than
       one copy unusable.
     - cups-browsed: If a queue left over from the last session
       gets confirmed, fill in the data structure with the Bonjour
       parameters, also update the Bonjour parameters if a local
       queue is upgraded from IPP to IPPS.

cups-filters (1.0.32-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release
     - cups-browsed: Shared algorithm to generate local queues based on
       browsed remote queue data between Bonjour and CUPS browsing, as the
       simpler method used for CUPS browsing could overwrite local print
       queues and had de-duplication problems, for example if the server
       appears on two IPs in the network (connected by both ethernet and
       WLAN).
     - cups-browsed: CUPS broadcasting also broadcasted non-shared,
       especially cups-browsed-generated printers. Switched to detection
       of non-shared printers by the appropriate bit in the printer-type
       bit field IPP attribute.
     - cups-browsed: Made CUPS broadcasting work also without BrowseAllow
       lines in cups-browsed.conf. In this case we accept all remote
       printers (LP: #1163764).
     - README: Updated documentation for cups-browsed.
     - Added more comments and examples to /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf.
     - cups-browsed: Added support for "...:<port>" extensions of
       BrowsePoll addresses. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat
       (LP: #1159213).

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Let cups-browsed overtake browsing-related directives from
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf into /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf. Comment out
    directives which introduce CUPS broadcasting/browsing so that users
    use this deprecated method only if absolutely necessary. Add
    comments to tell the user about how to use the added lines.

  * New upstream release
     - cups-browsed: cups-browsed removed valid local queues pointing to
       remote queues when cups-browsed did not shut down cleanly after
       the previous session, leaving the user with missing local accessor
       queues for some of the remote CUPS queues (LP: #1131149).
     - pdftopdf: Improved error output.
     - pdftopdf: getRotation now handles unusual cases more graceful
       (LP: #1154318).
     - cups-browsed: Do not remove a generated local print queue when
       it was made the system default printer (LP: #1146407).
     - texttopdf: Fixed corrupted pdf when a utf-8 title is given and
       corresponding crash with 'prettyprint' (LP: #1137438).

  * New upstream release
     - cups-browsed: Added daemon to browse the Bonjour broadcasts of
       shared remote CUPS printers and automatically add local raw queues
       pointing to them, to resemble the behavior of the former CUPS
       broadcasting/browsing which was dropped in CUPS 1.6. Now remote
       printers appear as local print queues as before, but with the
       standardized Bonjour broadcasting (LP: #1086019, LP: #1061063,

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Added another workaround for Kyocera printers: Some

     - Made the Poppler-based filters pdftopdf and pdftoopvp build with

cups-filters (1.0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Allow selection whether Ghostscript or Poppler is used
       at runtime, setting the "pdftops-renderer" option to "gs" or
       "pdftops". This way one can switch to Poppler per-queue if there
       are incompatibilities with certain PostScript printers.
     - pdftops: Allow setting an upper limit for the image rendering
       resolution, also at runtime, setting the option
       "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default" to the desired limit in dpi.
       "0" means no limit. Default limit is 1440 dpi. This prevents slow
       processing by the printer if very high resolutions are used or
       if the printing resolution is mis-detected by the pdftops filter.
     - pdftops: Fixed crash by wrong usage of sizeof() function when adding
       "Collate" to the fifth command line argument for the "pstops" CUPS
       filter call (LP: #982675).
     - pdftops: Removed newline from copies value when reading it from
       the "%%PDFTOPDFNumCopies" entry of the incoming PDF file.
     - pdftops: Silenced compiler warning about ignoring the return
       value of the write() function.
     - pdftops: Added a crash guard.
     - pdftops: Start determining the printing resolution with
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD(), this is the most reliable as often
       the choice names of the "Resolution" option are marketing names
       with higher numerical values than the actual resolution. Also
       ignore error exit values of cupsRasterInterpretPPD() as the
       function can error out after having found the resolution.
     - pdftops: If printing resolution is determined by
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD() do not stick on 100 dpi if the

cups-filters (1.0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation faults when using N-up with certain PDF
       files (LP: #980673) and when calling pdftopdf manually without
       specifyting a PPD file.
     - pdftops: Suppress image compression only for Brother printers as they
       really need this measure to print at all. This accelerates printer-
       internal job processing on most other printers (tested on HP and
       Kyocera). Also suppress page compression on Kyocera printers, this
       works around a bug in Kyocera's PostScript interpreters which makes
       printing pages with images very slow (LP: #977912).
     - pdftops: Determine printing resolution from the PPD file and supply
       it on the Ghostscript or pdftops (Poppler) command line, so that
       the renderer does the image rendering with a resolution matching the
       printer's resolution. This avoids too slow processing of the jobs
       by the printer's built-in PostScript interpreter. In addition
       a default resolution of 300 dpi is used for PPDs without any hint
       of the printer's resolution, as most PostScript lasers use multiples
       of 300 dpi as resolution (LP: #977912).

cups-filters (1.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

cups-filters (1.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - Updated all code copied from Poppler to the current state of Poppler,
       to fix any bugs or security vulnerabilities which were in that
       Poppler code.
     - Made Poppler-based PDF filters building with various versions of
       Poppler.
     - Deactivated MIME conversion rules which are not used by the PDF-
       based printing workflow.
     - Added generic PPD for native PDF printers.
     - Cleaned up sample PPD file HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
     - imagetopdf: Added support for native PDF printers.
     - imagetopdf, imagetoraster: Let image input "scale to fit"
       by default. This makes photo printing via AirPrint work,
       as the iOS devices send JPEG but do not allow setting options.
     - pdftops: Generally do not compress fonts and images, and
       also do not do CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs to make
       the PostScript output more compatible with buggy PostScript
       interpreters. The output gets 30-50% longer but will work on
       many more different printer models. Problems were also
       discovered on HP and not only on Brother (LP: #960666).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Drop debian/patches/poppler-pre-0.18.patch and patch machinery around it.
    It's not necessary with the current upstream version any more.

cups-filters (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - cups-filters 1.0.7 release
     - pdftops: Added debug mode for investigating PostScript printer
       incompatibilities and interpreter bugs. Now sending a job with
       "lpr -o psdebug" makes the filter sending uncompressed PostScript.
     - pdftops: Additional workaround for a bug in the PostsSript interpreters
       of Brother printers, calling Ghostscript with special command line
       options (LP: #955553).
     - pdftopdf: Correct handling of PJL output and page_log messages on
       native PDF printers and on printers using a driver after pdftopdf
       (including PostScript printers).
     - texttopdf: Full fontconfig support, several bug fixes and improvements
       to make the output work on more different PDF interpreters, including
       built-in interpreters in printers.
     - Fixed cupsfilters.drv PPD generator and rastertopclx filter to make the
       supported HP DesignJet printers actually work.
     - parallel backend: Use same method as CUPS to overcome infinite loop
       on side channel errors (LP: #936647, CUPS STR #4044).
     - "make clean" and "make distclesn" work also correctly now when called
       repeatedly (Closes: #663564).

cups-filters (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
    - cups-filters 1.0.4 release
    - texttopdf: Fall back to altermative fonts via fontconfig if the
      FreeMono TrueType fonts are not installed (Closes: #495598,
      Closes: #662660).
    - bannertopdf: Fix off-by-one error in page duplication
    - bannertopdf: Put indirect references to streams into the page's
      contents
    - bannertopdf: Let byte offsets for the Xref table of the PDF output
      being determined correctly also when the output goes to stdout
      (LP: #939735).
    - bannertopdf: Output multiple copies of the test page if duplex
      and/or N-up is chosen, to let the test page appear on all possible
      positions of the sheet (LP: #939530).
    - bannertopdf: Scale test page template to fit the job's page size,
      get and display full page geometry information, draw the frame which
      marks the printable area 1pt smaller, to assure that it gets completely
      visible (LP: #921073).
  * debian/local/default-testpage.pdf: Added missing "Q" operator to the end of
    the page. This broke N-up printing with pdftopdf (LP: #939530).
  * debian/control: Added explicit build dependency on libfontconfig1-dev.
    (Closes: #661127)
  * debian/control: Changed font dependency (for texttopdf) to "ttf-freefont |
    fonts-liberation | ttf-dejavu" instead of only "ttf-freefont"
    (Closes: #495598, Closes: #662660).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/control: Build against libpng-dev, with an alternative to the older
    libpng12-dev. (Closes: #662295)
  * debian/control: Prefer building against libtiff5-dev if available, falling  
    back to libtiff-dev.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Move from hardening-wrapper to using
    dpkg-buildflags. Bump dpkg-dev build dependency to (>= 1.16.1~) for this.
  * debian/copyright: Update Format header for official copyright format 1.0.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.
  * debian/rules: Drop LC_MESSAGES setting, leftover from cups.
  * debian/control: Bump libcupsimage2-dev build dependency to ensure to build
    against a version which does not conflict on the libtiff?-dev build
    dependency.
