Template: nbd-server/number
Type: string
Default: 0
_Description: Number of nbd-server instances to run:
 Multiple nbd-server processes may run to export multiple files or
 block devices. Please specify how many configurations for such servers you
 want to generate.
 .
 Note that you can always add extra servers by adding them to
 /etc/nbd-server/config, or by running "dpkg-reconfigure nbd-server".

Template: nbd-server/port
Type: string
_Description: TCP Port for server number ${number}:
 Please specify the TCP port this instance of nbd server will use for
 backwards compatibility with older clients.

Template: nbd-server/name
Type: string
_Description: Name of export ${number}:
 Please specify a name for this export.

Template: nbd-server/filename
Type: string
_Description: File to export (server number ${number}):
 Please specify a file name or block device that should be exported
 over the network. You can export a real block device (for instance
 "/dev/hda1"); a normal file (such as "/export/nbd/bl1"); or a
 bunch of files all at once. For the third option, you can
 use "%s" in the filename, which will be expanded to the
 IP-address of the connecting client. An example would be
 "/export/swaps/swp%s".
 .
 Note that it is possible to tune the way in which the IP address will
 be substituted in the file name. See "man 5 nbd-server" for details.

Template: nbd-server/autogen
Type: error
_Description: AUTO_GEN is set to "n" in /etc/nbd-server
 The /etc/nbd-server file contains a line that sets the AUTO_GEN variable
 to "n". The file will therefore not be regenerated automatically.
 .
 Note that the current version of the nbd-server package no longer uses
 /etc/nbd-server. Instead it uses a new configuration file, read by
 nbd-server itself (rather than the init script), which supports more
 options. See "man 5 nbd-server" for details.
 .
 If you remove or comment out the AUTO_GEN line, a file
 /etc/nbd-server/config in the new format may be generated based on the
 current configuration. Until then, the nbd-server installation will be
 broken.

Template: nbd-server/convert
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Convert old-style nbd-server configuration file?
 A pre-2.9 nbd-server configuration file has been found on this system.
 The current nbd-server package no longer supports this file and will
 not work if it is kept as is.
 .
 If you choose this option, the system will generate a new style
 configuration file based upon the old-style configuration file, which
 will be removed. Otherwise, configuration questions will be asked and
 the system will generate a new configuration file.
 .
 If a new-style configuration file already exists and you choose this
 option, you will shortly see a "modified configuration file" prompt, as
 usual.

Template: nbd-server/useports
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Support port-based exports?
 Since version 2.9.18, nbd-server supports name-based exports, rather
 than port-based ones. While this is generally preferable, you may have
 to support systems running an older version of nbd-client, or might
 need to go through a lot of trouble to update your older configurations
 in order to migrate to name-based exports. In either of those cases,
 you should accept this option.
 .
 Everyone else should leave the option at the default setting, which
 will cause nbd-server to only support name-based exports.
