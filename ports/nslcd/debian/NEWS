nss-pam-ldapd (0.9.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

    The 0.9 release changes the communication protocol used between the NSS
    and PAM modules on one end and the nslcd process on the other end.

    This means that after the upgrade, if the new nslcd is running, processes
    that have the old NSS or PAM module already loaded will be unable to
    perform queries.

    For example, if a screensaver that was running before the upgrade has
    locked the screen during the upgrade, the user will no longer be able to
    unlock the screen.

nss-pam-ldapd (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

    The package has been split into libnss-ldapd which contains the the NSS
    module, libpam-ldapd which contains the PAM module and nslcd which
    includes the daemon that performs the LDAP operations.

    The configuration file has been changed to /etc/nslcd.conf to reflect this
    new organisation of packages (upgrades should create this file based on
    any existing /etc/nss-ldapd.conf file).
