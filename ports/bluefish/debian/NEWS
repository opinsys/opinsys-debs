bluefish (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is Bluefish 2.0 and it will will replace your existing Bluefish 1.0
  installation. It comes with several new feature, like autocompletion and
  code/block folding.

  There was a package split. Binary (bluefish), highlighting files and
  autocompletion data (bluefish-data) and plugins (bluefish-plugins)
  are provided in separate packages. For the case you observe a crash and
  you want to send us a backtrace, the debugging symbols are shipped with
  a separate package (bluefish-dbg) too.
