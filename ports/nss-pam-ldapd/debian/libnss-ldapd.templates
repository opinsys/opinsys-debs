 the ldap datasource.

_Description: Remove LDAP from nsswitch.conf now?
 The following services are still configured to use LDAP for lookups:
   ${services}
 but the libnss-ldapd package is about to be removed.
 .
 You are advised to remove the entries if you don't plan on using LDAP for
 name resolution any more. Not removing ldap from nsswitch.conf should, for
 most services, not cause problems, but host name resolution could be affected
 in subtle ways.
 .
 You can edit /etc/nsswitch.conf by hand or choose to remove the entries
 automatically now. Be sure to review the changes to /etc/nsswitch.conf if you
 choose to remove the entries now.
