If you are using r8168-dkms because the in-kernel r8169 does not
support your NIC or is not working properly, please check the
following:

* Have you tried a more recent kernel? The problem may be fixed
  there already. In that case the current r8169 driver may be
  ported back to an older kernel - please report a bug against
  the Debian kernel package where r8169 is not working as
  expected.

* If no version of the in-kernel driver r8169 supports your NIC,
  please report this to the r8169 maintainers, so that this can
  be fixed:

    To: Realtek linux nic maintainers <nic_swsd@realtek.com>
    To: Francois Romieu <romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
    Cc: netdev@vger.kernel.org

  You may also wish to open a Debian bug report (against the
  src:linux package) and Cc that.


If you want to switch back from r8168-dkms to the in-kernel r8169
driver it is necessary to purge the r8168-dkms package,
otherwise the blacklist for r8169 won't be removed.
