    so we can drop any pretense of this still being an agglomeration of things
    or of needing to be one, and simply tack the packaging needed for X onto a

  * Add Provides: xserver-xorg-input-2 so the next X ABI transition will be

  * Update the udev rules for new tablets.  Lower-case the product ids since
    udev appears to be case sensitive doing string compares for hex values.

  * Drop the external module package, upstream seems to be syncing fairly

    Closes: #418008, #417140, #404471, #317287
  * Lintian now bitches about reusing DH_COMPAT for the source package, so

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 16 May 2006 23:35:37 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New linuxwacom release.  Better support for PenPartner, DTF-521
    and xorg7.  Kernel 2.6 < 2.6.8 no longer supported.
  * Remove patches incorporated upstream.
  * Specify xorg-sdk and xlib locations explicitly still to avoid
    linuxwacom trying to install to lib64 if a 64bit kernel is found.
    It can be worked around for 64 bit builds, but totally breaks
    building in a ia32 chroot on such a machine if we don't do this.
  * Disable building the kernel module with the support libs
    (or at least, try to).
  * Switch to DH_COMPAT level 5.
  * Fix the product id for DTF-720.

wacom-tools (0.7.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update the wacom-kernel-modules package for the change in kernel
    package names.  Reported as a followup to #317288, but this does
    not solve the original issue of upgrading a kernel without a change
    in the kernel version.

    Bark at the user to remove them if they have been changed locally.
    Being conffiles, they are not removed on upgrade, even if they

  * New upstream source.
  * The previous device snatching code will not work with
    kernel 2.6.13+, time to see what 2.6.16 has to offer
    in its place.  Closes: #350663
  * Build the wacom_drv module for xorg7, it is no longer
    supplied as part of the xorg source package.
  * Fix udev rules, again, it may still be a moving target,
    but let's hope its getting a little tired of ducking
    and weaving too.  We now provide a convenience link to
    /dev/input/wacom for users of a single tablet, and named
    links for the convenience of users with multiple tablets
    of different types.  Users with multiple tablets of the
    same type will need to bind them to the /dev/input/by-path
    nodes that correspond to each tablet.
    Closes: #324391, #358057
  * Re-implemented device rebinding from userspace, using a
    udev RUN rule and a small script to check and rebind
    if required.

wacom-tools (0.6.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Punt device snatching out to userspace via sysfs, it's the only
    way to be sure at present.  This is an(other) experimental
    implementation before the core kernel api is decided and only
    available for kernel 2.6.10 and later at this stage.
  * Add a udev rule to create /dev/input/wacom* for each
    wacom tablet device plugged in to the system.  Its a conffile
    so you can hard code your own device id's there if you want
    constant names that don't depend on the number of wacom devices
    you have and the order you plug them in.
  * Add a hotplug script to poke the module device snatching code.
  * Typo fix in 2.6.7/wacom.c Closes: #294642 thanks.
  * Patch missing functions into 2.6.8/wacom.c, I have a report
    that this works for people who really need it.  Closes: #287941
  * Add debhelper build-dep to the module package.  Closes: #290721
  * Add libx11 build-dep too until this is fixed properly upstream,
    and a dep on build-essential Closes: #288238 thanks.

wacom-tools (0.6.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed evdev patch since what it attempts to do is
    already handled in the kernel for cases where it might
    reliably work.

    Removed usbhid patch since we can get in before it
    without needing to manually maintain a list of 'quirks'.

    Removed mousedev and usbmouse patches, since the former
    is now built into 2.6 kernels anyway and cannot easily
    be replaced on the fly, and since this is simply the wrong
    approach to fixing the problem of dynamic device naming
    for generic devices IMO, it just hides it for some people
    until they buy another device.

    This and tested support for kernel 2.6, Closes: #281230
    and more...

  * Explicitly point configure at the kernel source.  Closes: #285206

  * Update the other libtool goop as well to fix FTBFS
    on mips and mipsel.  Closes: #285213

  * (ab)use a shared 'confdir' (and worse) to restore something like
    the functionality needed by wacom.modutils for wacom.modprobe
    until we can fix the kernel.  Don't try this at home kids, it is
    surely not best practice in any of the domains it kludges through.
    Though its as legal as falling asleep sober at the wheel ...

wacom-tools (0.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial trivial packaging.  Note this has only been tested with 2.4.27.
  * Provides the basics from the linuxwacom project -- test and config tools,
    and kernel modules in a convenient form for users of kernel packages.
    It does not provide an updated X11 module, hopefully any important parts
    of that will be ultimately be included by the X maintainers once I look
    at what they might accept.
  * Updated config.{guess,sub}.
  * Modify the version detection to handle a non-numeric suffix
    from --append_to_version or flavour.
  * Closes: #279555
