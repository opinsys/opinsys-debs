openssh (1:5.4p1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Smartcard support is now available using PKCS#11 tokens.  If you were
  previously using an unofficial build of Debian's OpenSSH package with
  OpenSC-based smartcard support added, then note that commands like
  'ssh-add -s 0' will no longer work; you need to use 'ssh-add -s
  /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so' instead.

openssh (1:3.8.1p1-9) experimental; urgency=low

  The ssh package has been split into openssh-client and openssh-server. If
  you had previously requested that the sshd server should not be run, then
  that request will still be honoured. However, the recommended approach is
  now to remove the openssh-server package if you do not want to run sshd.
  You can remove the old /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run marker file after doing
  that.

openssh (1:3.5p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of OpenSSH disables the environment option for public keys by
  default, in order to avoid certain attacks (for example, LD_PRELOAD). If
  you are using this option in an authorized_keys file, beware that the keys
  in question will no longer work until the option is removed.

  To re-enable this option, set "PermitUserEnvironment yes" in
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config after the upgrade is complete, taking note of the
  warning in the sshd_config(5) manual page.

openssh (1:3.0.1p1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  As of version 3, OpenSSH no longer uses separate files for ssh1 and ssh2
  keys. This means the authorized_keys2 and known_hosts2 files are no longer
  needed. They will still be read in order to maintain backward
  compatibility.
