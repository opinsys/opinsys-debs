This package was debianized by Philip Hands <phil@hands.com> on 31 Oct 1999
(with help from  Dan Brosemer <odin@linuxfreak.com>)

It was downloaded from here:

The Debian-specific parts of the package were initially derived from the
original ssh package, which has since been renamed as ssh-nonfree.

The Debian patch is distributed under the terms of the GPL, which you
can find in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2.

In addition, as a special exception, Matthew Vernon gives permission
to link the code of the Debian patch with any version of the OpenSSH
code which is distributed under a license identical to that listed in
the included Copyright file, and distribute linked combinations
including the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in
all respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSH.  If you
modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
so, delete this exception statement from your version.

The upstream source for this package is a combination of the ssh
branch that is being maintained by the OpenBSD team (starting from
the last version of SSH that was distributed under a free license),
and porting work by Damien Miller <damien@ibs.com.au> to get it
working on Linux.  Other people also contributed to this, and are
credited in /usr/share/doc/ssh/README.
