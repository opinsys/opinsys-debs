Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: secure shell (SSH) sftp server module, for SFTP access from remote machines

 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.

 This package provides the SFTP server module for the SSH server. It
 is needed if you want to access your SSH server with SFTP. The SFTP
 server module also works with other SSH daemons like dropbear.

Package: ssh
Priority: extra
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, openssh-client (>= ${binary:Version}), openssh-server (>= ${binary:Version})
Description: secure shell client and server (metapackage)
 This metapackage is a convenient way to install both the OpenSSH client
 and the OpenSSH server. It provides nothing in and of itself, so you
 may remove it if nothing depends on it.

Package: ssh-krb5
Section: oldlibs
Priority: extra
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, openssh-client (>= ${binary:Version}), openssh-server (>= ${binary:Version})
Description: secure shell client and server (transitional package)
 This is a transitional package depending on the regular Debian OpenSSH
 client and server, which now support GSSAPI natively. It will add the
 necessary GSSAPI options to the server configuration file. You can
 remove it once the upgrade is complete and nothing depends on it.

Package: ssh-askpass-gnome

Replaces: ssh (<< 1:3.5p1-3)
Provides: ssh-askpass
Description: interactive X program to prompt users for a passphrase for ssh-add
 This has been split out of the main openssh-client package so that
 openssh-client does not need to depend on GTK+.
 .
 You probably want the ssh-askpass package instead, but this is
 provided to add to your choice and/or confusion.

Description: secure shell client for the Debian installer
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, libnss-files-udeb
Description: secure shell server for the Debian installer
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server for use in debian-installer.
 Since it is expected to be used in specialized situations (e.g. S/390
 installs with no console), it does not provide any configuration.
