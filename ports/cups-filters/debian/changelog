cups-filters (1.0.34-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release
     - pdftopdf: Fixed duplex printing logic. Before when printing
       duplex jobs with multiple copies and a odd number of pages,
       the first page of the second copy got onto the back side of
       the last page of the first copy, rendering printing more than
       one copy unusable.
     - cups-browsed: If a queue left over from the last session
       gets confirmed, fill in the data structure with the Bonjour
       parameters, also update the Bonjour parameters if a local
       queue is upgraded from IPP to IPPS.

cups-filters (1.0.32-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release
     - cups-browsed: Shared algorithm to generate local queues based on
       browsed remote queue data between Bonjour and CUPS browsing, as the
       simpler method used for CUPS browsing could overwrite local print
       queues and had de-duplication problems, for example if the server
       appears on two IPs in the network (connected by both ethernet and
       WLAN).
     - cups-browsed: CUPS broadcasting also broadcasted non-shared,
       especially cups-browsed-generated printers. Switched to detection
       of non-shared printers by the appropriate bit in the printer-type
       bit field IPP attribute.
     - cups-browsed: Made CUPS broadcasting work also without BrowseAllow
       lines in cups-browsed.conf. In this case we accept all remote
       printers (LP: #1163764).
     - README: Updated documentation for cups-browsed.
     - Added more comments and examples to /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf.
     - cups-browsed: Added support for "...:<port>" extensions of
       BrowsePoll addresses. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat
       (LP: #1159213).

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Let cups-browsed overtake browsing-related directives from
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf into /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf. Comment out
    directives which introduce CUPS broadcasting/browsing so that users
    use this deprecated method only if absolutely necessary. Add
    comments to tell the user about how to use the added lines.

cups-filters (1.0.31-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - cups-browsed: cups-browsed removed valid local queues pointing to
       remote queues when cups-browsed did not shut down cleanly after
       the previous session, leaving the user with missing local accessor
       queues for some of the remote CUPS queues (LP: #1131149).

       corresponding crash with 'prettyprint' (LP: #1137438).
     - cups-browsed: Added CUPS Broadcasting for sharing local printers
       to remote CUPS clients with CUPS 1.5.x and older. Thanks to Tim
       Waugh from Red Hat.
     - cups-browsed: Added sample config-file and build-time default
       setting options. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat.
     - cups-browsed: Added CUPS browsing and BrowsePoll functionality, to
       be backwards compatible to CUPS 1.5.x and older servers. Thanks
       to Tim Waugh from Red Hat.
     - pdftopdf: Fixed incorrect evenDuplex page insertion (Upstream bug #1088).
     - pdftoopvp: Let it build with Poppler 0.22.x. Thanks to Koji Otani
       from BBR Inc. (Upstream bug #1089).

cups-filters (1.0.28-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - cups-browsed: Added daemon to browse the Bonjour broadcasts of
       shared remote CUPS printers and automatically add local raw queues
       pointing to them, to resemble the behavior of the former CUPS
       broadcasting/browsing which was dropped in CUPS 1.6. Now remote
       printers appear as local print queues as before, but with the
       standardized Bonjour broadcasting (LP: #1086019, LP: #1061063,
       LP: #1061069).

     - pdftops: Added support for using Adobe Reader (acroread) in command
       line mode for turning PDF to PostScript (Upstream bug #1065).
     - pdftops: Fix stripping of page management options from the pstops
       command line which got already applied by pdftopdf. If the name
       of the option to be removed is contained in the name of a option
       in the command line (like "number-up" in "number-up-layout" or

cups-filters (1.0.20-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Added another workaround for Kyocera printers: Some
       models get very slow on images which request interpolation,
       so now we remove the image interpolation requests by additional
       PostScript code only inserted for Kyocera printers (LP: #1026974).
     - Made the Poppler-based filters pdftopdf and pdftoopvp build with
       both Poppler 0.18.x and 0.20.x (Upstream bug #1055).
     - Fixes according to Coverity scan results (Upstream bug #1054).
     - Switched build system to autotools. This especially fixes several
       build problems in Gentoo. Also build-tested with CUPS 1.6.0b1.
     - Fixes for compatibility with clang/gcc-4.7.
     - textonly: Filter did not work as a pipe with copies=1 (Upstream bug
       #1032).
     - texttopdf: Avoid trimming the results of FcFontSort(), as this may
       miss some reasonable candidates under certain circumstances. BTW,
       fix passing a non-pointer as a pointer to "result" (Closes: #670055).
     - Corrected documentation. The option for the maximum image rendering
       resolution in pdftops is "pdftops-max-image-resolution", not
       "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default".
  * debian/patches/fcfontsort-no-trim.patch: Removed, fixed upstream.

cups-filters (1.0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Allow selection whether Ghostscript or Poppler is used
       at runtime, setting the "pdftops-renderer" option to "gs" or
       "pdftops". This way one can switch to Poppler per-queue if there
       are incompatibilities with certain PostScript printers.
     - pdftops: Allow setting an upper limit for the image rendering
       resolution, also at runtime, setting the option
       "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default" to the desired limit in dpi.
       "0" means no limit. Default limit is 1440 dpi. This prevents slow
       processing by the printer if very high resolutions are used or
       if the printing resolution is mis-detected by the pdftops filter.
     - pdftops: Fixed crash by wrong usage of sizeof() function when adding
       "Collate" to the fifth command line argument for the "pstops" CUPS
       filter call (LP: #982675).
     - pdftops: Removed newline from copies value when reading it from
       the "%%PDFTOPDFNumCopies" entry of the incoming PDF file.
     - pdftops: Silenced compiler warning about ignoring the return
       value of the write() function.
     - pdftops: Added a crash guard.
     - pdftops: Start determining the printing resolution with
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD(), this is the most reliable as often
       the choice names of the "Resolution" option are marketing names
       with higher numerical values than the actual resolution. Also
       ignore error exit values of cupsRasterInterpretPPD() as the
       function can error out after having found the resolution.
     - pdftops: If printing resolution is determined by
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD() do not stick on 100 dpi if the
       resolution cannot be determined (LP: #984082).
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation fault when printing selected pages
       ("page-ranges" option, LP: #980673).

cups-filters (1.0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation faults when using N-up with certain PDF
       files (LP: #980673) and when calling pdftopdf manually without
       specifyting a PPD file.
     - pdftops: Suppress image compression only for Brother printers as they
       really need this measure to print at all. This accelerates printer-
       internal job processing on most other printers (tested on HP and
       Kyocera). Also suppress page compression on Kyocera printers, this
       works around a bug in Kyocera's PostScript interpreters which makes
       printing pages with images very slow (LP: #977912).
     - pdftops: Determine printing resolution from the PPD file and supply
       it on the Ghostscript or pdftops (Poppler) command line, so that
       the renderer does the image rendering with a resolution matching the
       printer's resolution. This avoids too slow processing of the jobs
       by the printer's built-in PostScript interpreter. In addition
       a default resolution of 300 dpi is used for PPDs without any hint
       of the printer's resolution, as most PostScript lasers use multiples
       of 300 dpi as resolution (LP: #977912).

  * New upstream release
     - Updated all code copied from Poppler to the current state of Poppler,
       to fix any bugs or security vulnerabilities which were in that
       Poppler code.
     - Made Poppler-based PDF filters building with various versions of
       Poppler.
     - Deactivated MIME conversion rules which are not used by the PDF-
       based printing workflow.
     - Added generic PPD for native PDF printers.
     - Cleaned up sample PPD file HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
     - imagetopdf: Added support for native PDF printers.
     - imagetopdf, imagetoraster: Let image input "scale to fit"
       by default. This makes photo printing via AirPrint work,
       as the iOS devices send JPEG but do not allow setting options.
     - pdftops: Generally do not compress fonts and images, and
       also do not do CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs to make
       the PostScript output more compatible with buggy PostScript
       interpreters. The output gets 30-50% longer but will work on
       many more different printer models. Problems were also
       discovered on HP and not only on Brother (LP: #960666).

cups-filters (1.0~b1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. This is a splitout of all filters which are currently
    being shipped by the "cups" package but are not provided by upstream any
    more. These now have a new home at openprinting.org. Upload to
    experimental for getting it through NEW, then cups and cups-filters will
    be uploaded to unstable in lockstep.
