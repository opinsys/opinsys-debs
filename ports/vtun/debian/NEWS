vtun (2.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from 2.6-5, vtun has stopped using /etc/vtund-start.conf.
  Configuration parameters about which instances to create are now stored in
  /etc/default/vtun.
  The installation script will try to perform an automatic upgrade, please
  check that it is OK. 

  Pidfiles now include the session name and hostname, so you can have more
  than one instance of the same session name.

  Also, now includes a logrotate script for correct housekeeping of dump
  files.
